The benefit of widespread use of the Internet is like smelling a rat, because of the fact that people’s memory and critical thinking skills are deteriorating. This essay agrees that the information flow is detrimental to humanity if it is not under control. The two most serious problems of it are, the loss of ability to remember due to uselessness and the memory overflow as result of a big amount of incoming information.

First and foremost, the main consequence of constant availability of any information is that retaining all data becomes a mug’s game. Firstly, it’s getting impossible to memorize all incoming data from the Internet to store due to a significant number of it. Secondly, there is no need for this on account of accessibility of the Internet anytime. For example, in my childhood I had a need to memorize some interesting facts if I wanted to tell friends about it. Nowadays I can just send a link or “google” at the right moment.

Furthermore, a large quantity of incoming information leads to the memory overflow that is affecting our ability to concentrate and to store data. To put it simply, the constant social networking, the different types of entertainment like computer games, films are filling all free time and memory which results in low productivity, degradation and lack of interesting insights. For instance, I like to do experiments on myself and I have identified that I'll know a lot more on the weekends when I just get off social networks.

Considering all of the above, the constant use of the Internet leads to bad consequences. To my mind, we need to have conscious application of consistent availability of the Internet.
